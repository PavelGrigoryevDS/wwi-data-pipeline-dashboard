## 📌 Project Overview

Wide World Importers (WWI) is a global distributor of consumer goods, dealing with suppliers and clients worldwide.

WWI aims to enhance the visibility of key business performance indicators for rapid decision-making. Currently, data is siloed across the operational database, and management spends significant time manually compiling reports, leading to delayed and inefficient insights.

**Project Goal:**  

To build an automated, end-to-end analytics pipeline and an interactive dashboard. This system will provide leadership and the sales, procurement, and logistics departments with a single source of truth for key metrics related to sales performance and delivery efficiency.

**Expected Outcome:**

The final dashboard will drastically reduce data analysis time, enable the identification of trends and anomalies, and support strategic and operational decision-making based on accurate, consolidated information.

## 🚀 How to Run This Project

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+ installed
- Git (for cloning)
- PostgreSQL (local or cloud)
  
### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PavelGrigoryevDS/wwi-data-pipeline-dashboard.git
cd wwi-data-pipeline-dashboard
```

###  Database Deployment

To reproduce this project, you'll need to create 2 empty PostgreSQL databases:

- One for the source database (WWI dump)
- One for the analytical database

#### Creating Empty PostgreSQL Databases

##### Option 1: Local PostgreSQL
1. **Install PostgreSQL**:
   - [Download PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) for your OS
   - Or use Docker:
     ```bash
     docker run --name wwi_db -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
     ```

##### Option 2: Cloud Services (Free Tier)
Choose one of these services:
- [Neon.tech](https://neon.tech/) 
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) 
- [Render](https://render.com/)

#### Restoring the Database

Next you'll need to restore the database from the provided dump file. You can use either a local PostgreSQL instance or a cloud service.

The database dump file is located in the `assets` folder named `wide_world_importers_pg.dump`

Use this command to restore the dump file:

```bash
pg_restore \
  -h [HOST] \          # For cloud: your-db-host.url.com | For local: localhost
  -U [USERNAME] \      # For cloud: your_db_owner | For local: postgres
  -d [DATABASE_NAME] \ # Database name (check your cloud provider)
  -Fc \                # Specifies custom format dump
  --no-owner \         # Ignores ownership permissions
  --no-privileges \    # Ignores privilege assignments
  assets/wide_world_importers_pg.dump
```

### Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory with your database connection details:

```env
# Source Database
WWI_NEON_HOST=your_source_host
WWI_NEON_DB=your_source_db
WWI_NEON_USER=your_source_user
WWI_NEON_PASSWORD=your_source_password
WWI_NEON_SSLMODE=require
WWI_NEON_CHANNEL_BINDING=disable

# Analytical Database
WWI_ANALYTICS_NEON_HOST=your_analytics_host
WWI_ANALYTICS_NEON_DB=your_analytics_db
WWI_ANALYTICS_NEON_USER=your_analytics_user
WWI_ANALYTICS_NEON_PASSWORD=your_analytics_password
WWI_ANALYTICS_NEON_SSLMODE=require
WWI_ANALYTICS_NEON_CHANNEL_BINDING=disable
```

### Install and Run

- If Poetry is NOT installed on your system, use Option 1
- If Poetry IS installed, use Option 2

#### Option 1: Using pip + virtualenv

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  
pip install poetry
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true --local
poetry install
jupyter lab wwi-data-pipeline-dashboard.ipynb
```

#### Option 2: Poetry

```bash
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true --local
poetry install
poetry run jupyter lab wwi-data-pipeline-dashboard.ipynb
```
