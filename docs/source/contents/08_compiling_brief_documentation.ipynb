    "## Frequently Asked Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What does YoY mean and how is it calculated?\n",
    "\n",
    "YoY stands for Year-over-Year.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is a key performance metric that compares a specific period (e.g., a month) to the exact same period in the previous year.\n",
    "- This eliminates seasonal effects and provides a clearer view of growth trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "(Metric Value for Current Period / Metric Value for Same Period Previous Year) - 1\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How are delayed orders defined?\n",
    "\n",
    "An order is classified as delayed if the actual delivery date is later than the promised/scheduled delivery date.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is shown on the sparkline charts?\n",
    "\n",
    "The sparklines provide a visual history of a metric's performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The solid line represents the monthly values for the most recent 12-month period.\n",
    "- The shaded dashed line behind it represents the values for the same months from the previous year (a 12-month period offset by one year).\n",
    "\n",
    "This overlay allows for an instant visual comparison of current performance against the historical benchmark."
